# Privacy Policy

PyDeck respects your privacy. This policy explains what data the app uses and how it’s handled.

## Data We Collect

- No personal data is collected.
- The app stores your quiz progress (best score per level) locally on your device.
- No analytics SDKs or third‑party trackers are embedded in the app.

## Crash/Error Information

- The app may write basic error information to local storage to help diagnose issues. This data never leaves your device unless you choose to share it with support.
- System crash logs, if any, may be available to you in Settings → Privacy → Analytics & Improvements and to your Apple developer account in App Store Connect.

## Network Access

- PyDeck’s core features work offline. The app does not require an account or network connection to use flashcards and quizzes.
