# PyDeck Support

Welcome! This page covers help for the PyDeck iOS app (bundle ID `com.venki18.pydeck`).

## Contact

## FAQ

- How do I reset my progress?
  Open the app, go to the first level, and tap Retry to start over. A per‑level best score is saved on device only.

- Do I need an account?
  No. PyDeck stores progress locally on your device. No accounts, logins, or cloud sync.

- Does it work offline?
  Yes. After the first install, decks and quizzes work without a network connection.

## Troubleshooting

- App won’t open or behaves unexpectedly: restart the device and try again. If it persists, reinstall the app.
- Accessibility: PyDeck supports Dynamic Type and VoiceOver labels for key actions.
